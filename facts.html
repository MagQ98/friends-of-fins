                <h3>There are over 500 species of shark</h3>
                <p>143 of these are under threat, listed by IUCN from vulnerable to critically endangered.</p>

                <h3>They’ve been around for a long time</h3>
                <p>Sharks have been around for over 400 million years - long before dinosaurs. Because their skeletons
                    are made of cartilage (like our noses) instead of bones, they don’t leave fossils like other animals
                    – but fossilised shark teeth have been found.

                <h3>They can vary dramatically in size</h3>
                <p>From the smallest dwarf lantern shark (which is about the size of a human hand), to the largest which
                    can be up to 12 metres long - the whale shark.</p>

                <h3>Most sharks are cold-blooded</h3>
                <p>For most sharks, their body temperature is cold, like the temperature of the water they swim in. But
                    unlike most sharks, great white sharks are partially warm-blooded, allowing them to move faster when
                    hunting prey.</p>

                <h3>Sharks have a sixth sense</h3>
                <p>All sharks have a 'sixth sense' that helps them hone in on prey during the final phase of attack: the
                    ‘amupllae of lorenzini’ are found on sharks' snouts and can sense the electric fields emitted by
                    animals in the surrounding water.</p>

                <h3>Sharks do not have bones.</h3>
                <p>Sharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known as
                    "elasmobranchs", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff
                    that your ears and nose tip are made of. This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates.
                    Their cartilaginous skeletons are much lighter than true bone and their large livers are full of
                    low-density oils, both helping them to be buoyant. </p>

                <h3>Shark skin feels similar to sandpaper.</h3>
                <p>Shark skin feels exactly like sandpaper because it is made up of tiny teeth-like structures called
                    placoid scales, also known as dermal denticles. These scales point towards the tail and help reduce
                    friction from surrounding water when the shark swims.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fact-color3 grow">
                <h3>Most sharks have good eyesight.</h3>
                <p>Most sharks can see well in dark lighted areas, have fantastic night vision, and can see colors. The
                    back of sharks’ eyeballs have a reflective layer of tissue called a tapetum. This helps sharks see
                    extremely well with little light.</p>

            <div class="fact-color1 grow">
                <h3>Different shark species reproduce in different ways.</h3>
                <p>Sharks exhibit a great diversity in their reproductive modes. There are oviparous (egg-laying)
                    species and viviparous (live-bearing) species. Oviparous species lay eggs that develop and hatch
                    outside the mother's body with no parental care after the eggs are laid.</p>
