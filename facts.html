        There are over 500 species of shark 
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide1">
        143 of these are under threat, listed by IUCN from vulnerable to critically endangered.  
       </div>

       <div class="fact-head fact-box2">
        They’ve been around for a long time
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide2">
        Sharks have been around for over 400 million years - long before dinosaurs. Because their skeletons are made of cartilage (like our noses) instead of bones, they don’t leave fossils like other animals – but fossilised shark teeth have been found.
       </div>
       <br>
       <div class="fact-head fact-box3">
        They can vary dramatically in size
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide3">
        From the smallest dwarf lantern shark (which is about the size of a human hand), to the largest which can be up to 12 metres long - the whale shark.
       </div>

       <div class="fact-head fact-box1">
        Most sharks are cold-blooded
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide1">
        For most sharks, their body temperature is cold, like the temperature of the water they swim in.  But unlike most sharks, great white sharks are partially warm-blooded, allowing them to move faster when hunting prey.

       <div class="fact-head fact-box2">
        Sharks have a sixth sense
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide2">
        All sharks have a 'sixth sense' that helps them hone in on prey during the final phase of attack: the ‘amupllae of lorenzini’ are found on sharks' snouts and can sense the electric fields emitted by animals in the surrounding water.

        Sharks do not have bones
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide1">
        Sharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known as "elasmobranchs", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff that your ears and nose tip are made of. This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates. Their cartilaginous skeletons are much lighter than true bone and their large livers are full of low-density oils, both helping them to be buoyant.

        Shark skin feels similar to sandpaper
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide2">
        Shark skin feels exactly like sandpaper because it is made up of tiny teeth-like structures called placoid scales, also known as dermal denticles. These scales point towards the tail and help reduce friction from surrounding water when the shark swims.

       <div class="fact-head fact-box3">
        Most sharks have good eyesight
       </div>
       <div class="fact-hide3">
        Most sharks can see well in dark lighted areas, have fantastic night vision, and can see colors. The back of sharks’ eyeballs have a reflective layer of tissue called a tapetum. This helps sharks see extremely well with little light.
