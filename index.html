        <h1>Why are people so afraid of sharks?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Over the years, sharks have gotten a bad reputation as bloodthirsty man-eaters. A lot of this can be blamed on the media's portrayal of them. By his own admission and with considerable regret, Peter Benchley has a lot to do with our fear of sharks. The fiction author’s hugely successful book Jaws and the resulting 1975 blockbuster movie instilled a deep fear of sharks in people across the world.
            The story of a rampaging shark hell bent on consuming beach goers day-after-day has no resemblance to reality. Unfortunately, it left a lasting impression on the public.  The realistic (for its time) looking shark accentuated our fear … and then along came movies like 47 Meters Down, The Reef and many, many others to exacerbate those fears.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            Every year, the finds of between 26 and 73 million sharks are traded in markets around the world. Far more are likely killed at sea, though we will never know just how many. The threats we pose are many. By-catch: the accidental killing of sharks in fishing gear intended for other species. Illegal poaching and hunting: selling shark fins for soup and sport fishing for shark-jaw trophies. Nets: placed along coastlines to keep sharks away from beaches. It turns out that sharks have more reason to fear humans than the other way around
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To put that into perspective, you're at a much higher risk of dying of heart disease (1 in 5 chance), of cancer (1 in 7 chance) or in a car accident (1 in 84 chance) than you are of being the victim of a shark attack. Worldwide, there are only about 70 to 100 shark attacks annually. Only 5 to 15 of those attacks are fatal. Let me put it this way: the likelihood of you being attacked is about 1 in 11.5 million. 
Safe to say, your chances of running into a shark are slim
On the other hand, humans kill over 100 million sharks every year. This works out to about 11,000 sharks dying every hour.

        <h1>What other dangers are sharks facing?</h1>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Sharks are undergoing habitat degradation and loss.</li>
            <p>Things like mangrove deforestation, coastal development, and poor water quality from pollution all jeopardize the environments sharks live in. Sharks in fresh or brackish waters and coastal areas (near human activity) are the most at risk</p>
            <br>
            <li>Sharks are threatened by pollution.</li>
            <p>Human pollution does more than just damage shark habitats. Toxins from mercury and DDT can accumulate in shark tissue over time as the sharks feed on prey that is chemically contaminated. Like other sea creatures, sharks can also become tangled in or accidentally swallow physical plastic pollution.</p>
            <br>
            <li>There is a growing trade and demand for shark fins and their meat.</li>
            <p>This leads to commercial overfishing of sharks as well as sharks becoming trapped in commercial fishing equipment. Sharks are often caught accidentally, too. Each year, commercial fisheries unintentionally catch an estimated 50 million sharks. Since their fins are so sought after, they are sometimes cut off and the shark is dumped back into the sea to die.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Sharks grow slowly and produce few offspring relative to other marine species.</li>
            <p>Their slow growth means that they’re unable to replenish their populations quickly when threatened by issues like habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing. This makes them extremely susceptible to such problems.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Climate change is expected to affect sharks.</li>
            <p>Sharks are slow to adapt to new conditions, such as warming oceans, since they grow so slowly and mature late in life. Climate change also causes oceans to become more acidic, and studies have found that certain species have trouble smelling prey in acidified water.</p>

        <h1>How can we help?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Sharks are absolutely critical to both our ocean ecosystems as well as to our planet, and they need our help. Here are some simple things you can do to help out our underwater friends:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never eat shark fin soup or shark meat</li>
            <li>Don’t purchase products that contain shark (such as makeup or beauty products)</li>
            <li>When you eat seafood, make sure it’s ethically and sustainably caught</li>
            <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle (especially when it comes to plastic)</li>
            <li>Volunteer with a shark conservation organization or attend a beach clean up</li>
            <li>Talk to others and spread awareness about why sharks need our help</li>
            <li>Stop being afraid of sharks</li>
            <li>Continue to learn why we are a much greater danger to sharks than they are to us. There are many ways you can help protect sharks both locally and globally. Get involved in conservation efforts and let your voice be heard by those with the power to enact real change.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>You can help protect threatened species and their habitats today with a donation to any of the amazing charities available <a href="index.html">here</a>. Your support of any of these groups of people who have dedicated their lives to making the oceans a safer place for Sharks will make a world of difference.</p>
